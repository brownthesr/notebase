### definition continuous mappings

let $(X,d)$ and $(Y,\tilde d)$ be metric spaces

A mapping $T:X\rightarrow Y$ is continuous at $x_0\in X$ if
$$\begin{align}
\forall \epsilon > 0 \exists \delta > 0 \text{ such that }\\
 d(x,x_0) <\delta \implies \tilde d (Tx,Tx_0) < \epsilon
\end{align}$$
this is equivalent to :
$$\begin{align}
\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, s.t. T(B(x_0,\delta)) \subset B(Tx_0,\epsilon)
\end{align}$$
This is another definition even more general

A mapping $T:X\rightarrow Y$, X,Y are topological spaces is continuous iff
$$\begin{align}
S\subset Y \text{open} \implies T^{-1}(S) \text{open}\\
T^{-1} (S) = \{x\in X,| Tx\in S\}
\end{align}$$
Proof for metric spaces

Let $S$ be open, we need to show that the inverse image of S is open. Let $x\in T^{-1}(S)$ then for sure we know that $y=Tx\in S$. But S is open that means $\exists \epsilon > 0$ such that $B(y,\epsilon)\subset S$. By continuity we can choose a $\delta >0$ such that $T(B(x,\delta))\subset B(y,\epsilon)\subset S$

Thus $B(x,\delta)\subset T^{-1}(S)$ So we were able to find an open ball that surrounds x. Since x was arbitrary that means that the inverse image of S is open.

For the other direction $B(Tx, \epsilon)$ is open in Y, by the definition of continuity in topological spaces. Then the inverse image of the ball is open in X.
$$\begin{align}
\exists \delta >0 \text{ such that } B(x,\delta)\subset T^{-1}(B(Tx,\epsilon))
\end{align}$$
Thus T is continuous in a metric space manner.

### Definition Accumulation point
Let $M\subset X$ be a metric space. A point $x_0\in X$ is an accumulation point or limit point of $M$ if every neighborhood of $x_0$ contains at least one $x\in M$ with $x\neq x_0$

### Definition
$\overline M =$ closure of M = M and all of its accumulation point.

This is equivalent to saying that $\overline M$ is the smallest closed set containing M. Or the intersection of all closed sets containing M.

The interior of $M$ or $\dot M$ can be the union of all open sets in M.

Question: Find an intersection of open sets that is not not open

### Definition
$M\subset X$ is dense in X if $\overline M=X$

Example take the rationals.

### Definition
$X$ is separable if we can find a countable dense subset.

Example $\R$ is separable since $\overline \Q = \R$ and Q is countable.

Unexample $l^\infty$ is not separable.

Pf: let $y=(y_1,\dots)$ such that $y_\in\{0,1\}$ this is definitely in $l^\infty$

To each of these sequences we assign a number
$$\begin{align}
\hat y = \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{y_k}{2^k}\right)
\end{align}$$
This is an invertible mapping, or one to one.

So there are uncountably many binary sequences in $l^\infty$

$d(y,\tilde y) = 1$ if $y\neq \tilde y$ Since this is the infinity norm.

$B(y,\frac{1}{3})$ are balls that are not intersecting and centered at a binary sequence.

if $\overline M = l^\infty$ then M must have at least one point in each of these balls. So $M$ is uncountable. (uuuuuuuuuuuu)
<!-- TODO: Practice Proving me  -->

We will now prove that the $l^p$ is separable.

pf:
$M$ is the set of all sequences y of the form $y=(y_1,\dots, y_n,0,\dots)$, for any n with $y_i\in Q$ that means that M is countable.

Let $\epsilon > 0, x=(x_1,x_2,\dots)\in l^p$

Since this is in $l^p$ then $\exists n\in N$ such that $\sum\limits_{j=n+1}^{\infty}\left(|x_j|^p\right)< \epsilon^p/2$ (This follows from convergence of series so tail goes to zero).

Since $\overline Q = \R, \exists y \in M$ such that $\sum\limits_{j=1}^{M}\left(|x_j-y_j|^p\right)<\epsilon^p/2$

$$\begin{align}
d(x,y)^p=\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}\left(|x_j-y_j|^p\right)+\sum\limits_{j=n+1}^{\infty}\left(|x_j|^p\right)\\
\leq \epsilon^p
\end{align}$$
Thus the distance is less than $\epsilon$ and this space is separable.

## 1.4 Convergence Cauchy Sequences Completeness
### Definition convergence of sequences
A sequence $(x_n)\subset X$ in a metric space converges if

$$\begin{align}
\exists x\in X, \limits_{n \rightarrow \infty}d(x_n,x)=0
\end{align}$$
Divergent means not convergent in X.
### Definition Bounded set
$M\subset X, M\neq \empty$ is a bounded set if  its diameter is finite, Or we can fit it in a ball.
$$\begin{align}
\sup_{x,y}d(x,y)<\infty
\end{align}$$
### Definition Bounded Sequence
a sequence is bounded if it is bounded as a set (maximum distance between any two elements is bounded)

### Lemma
1. convergence $\implies$ boundedness
2.  $x_n\rightarrow x,y_n\rightarrow y\implies d(x_n,y_n)\rightarrow d(x,y)$

pf (1): Assume that $x_n\rightarrow x$. $\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists N$ with $n>N\implies d(x_n,x)<\epsilon$

Pick $\epsilon = 1$ then we then we can fit the whole sequence in $B(x,r), r= \max(1,d(x,x_1),\dots,d(x,x_{n-1}))$ so it is bounded.

pf (2):
$$\begin{align}
d(x_n,y_n)\leq d(x_n,x)+d(x,y)+d(y_n,y)\\
d(x_n,y_n) - d(x,y)\leq d(x_n,x)+d(y_n,y)
\end{align}$$
Additionally note
$$\begin{align}
d(x,y)\leq d(x,x_n)+d(x_n,y_n)+d(y_n,y)\\
d(x,y)-d(d_n,y_n)\leq  d(x_n,x)+d(y_n,y)
\end{align}$$
Thus:
$$\begin{align}
|d(x,y)-d(d_n,y_n)|\leq  d(x_n,x)+d(y_n,y)
\end{align}$$
And the right inequality approaches zero.
### Definition Cauchy Sequences
A sequence $x_n$ is cauchy if
$$\begin{align}
\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists N, m,n>N\implies d(x_n,x_m) < \epsilon
\end{align}$$
### Definition Completeness
A metric space $X$ is complete iff every cauchy sequence in X is a convergent sequence.

Note that in general convergent $\implies$ cauchy but not the other way around.

### Theorem
- $x\in \overline M\iff \exists x_n\in M, x_n\rightarrow x$
- if $M$ is closed $\iff$ any convergent squence converges to something in $X$. (Closed sets contain all of their limit points).
- If $M\subset X$ and X is a complete metric space, then M is complete $\iff$ M is closed.
- A mapping $T:X\rightarrow Y$ where $X,Y$ are metric spaces. Then T is continuous $\iff$ $x_n\rightarrow x\implies Tx_n\rightarrow Tx_n$

### Next Time
We will show that $l^\infty$ is complete.
