# 2.10 Normed Vector spaces of Operators, dual space

The vector space of all bounded linear operators from $X\rightarrow Y$ is $B(X,Y)$ (Implicit assumption $D(T)=X$)

## Theorem: this is a normed vector space

The operations:
$$\begin{align}
(T+S)(x)=T(x)+S(x)\\
(\alpha T)(x)=\alpha T(x)
\end{align}$$

Note this is different hatn earlier because the algebraic dual is not necessarily bounded.

## Theorem: If Y is Banach then $B(X,Y)$ is Banach

Proof: let $T_n\subset B(X,Y)$ be cauchy so:
$$\begin{align}
\forall\epsilon>0,\exists N, nm>N\implies ||T_n-T_m||<\epsilon\\
\forall x\in X\\
||T_nx-T_mx||\leq ||T_n-T_m||||x||\leq \epsilon ||x||
\end{align}$$
So if we fix $x$ then this sequence on the left is cauchy. we can find $\epsilon_x, \epsilon_x||x||< \tilde{\epsilon}$

So then the sequence of the images are cauchy in Y which is complete so they converge. call this limit $Tx=y$ since the limit depends on the choice of $x$. So we can think of y as an operator that associates x to the limit $y=Tx$. This operator can be shown to be linear.

We still need to show that our sequence converges to this guess and that our guess is in our space (we already know that its in our space). for the converges just let m go to infinity in the first norm (5). so:
$$\begin{align}
||T_nx-Tx||\leq \epsilon ||x||
\end{align}$$
So then we know that $T_n-T$ is bounded. So $T=T_n-(T_n-T)$. And since both of these are bounded then $T$ belongs to the bounded linear operators.

In addition the norm must be less than or equal to epsilon. But we can make epsilon arbitrary so $T_n\rightarrow T$ in the operator norm

Let $X'$ be the space of all bounded linear functionals on X. By the previous theorem this is always a banach space since $\R$ is complete.

## Example
$\R^n$  so duh $(\R^n)'=(\R^n)^*=\R^n$. These are always equal because all linear functionals are bounded on finite dimensional spaces:
$$\begin{align}
f(x)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}\left(\alpha_ix_i\right)\\
|f(x)|\leq \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}\left(|\alpha_ix_i|\right)\leq ||\alpha|| ||x||
\end{align}$$
so the norm of this function is boudned by $\alpha$. choosing $x=\alpha$ and we achieve this bound.

## $(l^1)'=l^\infty$
but not the other way around.

proof: define shauder basis of $l^1$ namely $e_1,e_2,\dots$ etc. So if $x\in l^1$ then:
$$\begin{align}
x=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(\xi_ke_k\right)
\end{align}$$
choose $f\in (l^1)'$ so f is linear and bounded
$$\begin{align}
f(x)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(\xi_kf(e_k)\right)\\
|f(x)|\leq\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(|\xi_k||f(e_k)|\right)\\
|f(x)|\leq M\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(|\xi_k|\right)\\
|f(x)|\leq ||x||
\end{align}$$
furthermore take $f(e_k)\leq ||f||||e_k||=||f||$. so $f(e_k)\in l^\infty$

define $g(x)=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(\xi_kb_k\right)$. where $b\in l^\infty$. We basically show that $g$ is bounded so it is in $l^1'$

Read book. way better. Is length preserved?

Take $f\in (l^1)'$
$$\begin{align}
|f(x)|\leq ||x||\sup |f(e_j)|
\end{align}$$
So $||f||\leq \sup |f(e_j)|$

now we just need to show the other direction $|f(e_j)|\leq ||f||||e_j||=||f||$. So we have that $||f||=\sup|f(e_j)|$

You can show that $(l^p)'=l^q$ using holders inequality
