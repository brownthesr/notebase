# 2.5

## Definition

A Metric Space X is sequentially compact if every sequence in X has a convergent subsequence.

## lemma: M is compact implies closed and bounded

pf:
Let $x\in \overline{M}$ we need to show that x is in M. We then know that there is a sequence $x_n\in X$ such that $x_n\rightarrow x$. By definition of compactness there is a subsequence that converges to something in M. But subsequences converge to the same limit so $x\in M$.

## Unit ball theorem

One direction is already proved for the closed unit ball.

Assume by way of contradiction that the unit ball is compact and the dimension of X is infinite.

pick $x_1\in X$ with norm one. Clearly then span $x_1$ is a proper subset of X. By the reiz lemma there is an $x_2\in X$ with norm one such that :
$$\begin{align}
||x_1-x_2||\leq 1/2
\end{align}$$

Do this again and again building off of earlier spans. Clearly this is a sequence. It should have a convergent subsequence but it cannot since they are always more than 1/2 away from each other. So there is no convergent subsequence. So it cannot be compact.

# 2.6: Linear operators

# 2.7 Bounded and Continuous linear operators

## Definition
An operator T is bounded if there is a $c>0$ such that for all x in the domain:
$$\begin{align}
||Tx||\leq c||x|
\end{align}$$
## Norm of an operator:
$$\begin{align}
||T||=\sup_{x\neq 0}\frac{||Tx||}{||x||}
\end{align}$$

### Example
the derivative operator is not bounded

Another example of a bounded linear operator

kernel:
$$\begin{align}
T:C[0,1]\rightarrow C[0,1]
\end{align}$$
such that
$$\begin{align}
(Tx)(t)=\int\limits_{0}^{1}k(t,s)x(s)ds
\end{align}$$
where k is continuous. T is bounded:
$$\begin{align}
||Tx|| = \max_{t\in[0,1]}|\int\limits_{0}^{1}k(t,s)x(s)ds|\\
\leq \max_{t\in[0,1]} \int\limits_{0}^{1}|k(t,s)||x(s)|ds\\
\leq K\max |x(s)|\\
=K||x||
\end{align}$$

## Theorem Bounded=Continuous (Know how to prove this)
Let $T:D(T)\rightarrow Y$ where T is linear and X,Y are normed vector spaces.

Bounded is the same thing as continuous

pf: Assume $T$ is bounded hten:
$$\begin{align}
||Tx-Ty|| \leq ||T||||x-y||
\end{align}$$
let $\epsilon > 0$ choose $\delta \leq \frac{\epsilon}{||T||}$ then:
$$\begin{align}
||Tx-Ty||\leq \epsilon
\end{align}$$
In the other direction assume that $T$ is continuous then for every $\epsilon,\exists \delta > 0$ with :
$$\begin{align}
||Tx-Tx_0||\leq \epsilon\\
||x-x_0||\leq \delta
\end{align}$$
The idea here is to pick $x=x_0+\frac{\delta}{||y||}y$ then clearly $x-x_0< \delta$ then we know:
$$\begin{align}
\epsilon > ||Tx-Tx_0||=||Ty||\frac{\delta}{||y||}
\end{align}$$
then
$$\begin{align}
\frac{||Ty||}{||y||}< \frac{\epsilon }{\delta}
\end{align}$$
So it is bounded

This constant was independent of the $y$ then this holds for all $y\in D(T)$

## Theorem: all linear operators in finite dimensional normed space are bounded.
## Theorem: Continuity at a Single point implies continuity everywhere.
Let T be linear. If it is continuous at a single point then it is continuous everywhere
## Theorem: Closed null space
$$\begin{align}
Tx_n\rightarrow Tx
\end{align}$$
The null space is closed.
### Facts:
$$\begin{align}
||T_2T_1||\leq ||T_2||||T_1||
\end{align}$$
## Theorem Bounded Linear Extension
Let $T$ be linear and bounded Assume Y is a banach space then

$$\begin{align}
||\tilde T||=||T||\\
\tilde T:\overline{D(T)}\rightarrow Y
\end{align}$$
$\tilde T$ is linear

Proof: $x\in \overline{D(T)}$ means that there is a sequence $x_n\rightarrow x\in D(T)$
$$\begin{align}
||Tx_n-Tx_m||\leq ||T||||x_n-x_m||
\end{align}$$
so this is a cauchy sequence in a complete space so it has a limit $y= \tilde T x$

Skipped that $\tilde T$ is linear and he limit is independent of choice of $x_n$

$$\begin{align}
||Tx_m||\leq ||T||||x_m||\\
||\tilde Tx||\leq ||T||||x||
\end{align}$$
