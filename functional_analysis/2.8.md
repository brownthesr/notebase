# 2.8 Linear functionals

## Def Linear functional

a lienar functional f is a linera operator
$$\begin{align}
f:D(f)\rightarrow \R
\end{align}$$
Or C.

## Definition: Bounded linear functional
f is bounded as a linear operator

The norm of the linear functional is the smallest such bound:
$$\begin{align}
||f||=\sup_{\substack{x\in D(f)\\||x||=1}}|f(x)|
\end{align}$$
$|f(x)|\leq ||f||||x||$. Just as before f is continuous iff f is bounded.

### Examples
- the inner product $f(x)=y_0^Tx$. Clearly f is bounded by cauchy shwartz
- $L^p[0,1],1<p<\infty$
choose a conjugate exponent $q,\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=1$. choose $y\in L^{q}[0,1]$
$$\begin{align}
f(x)=\int_0^1x(s)y(s)ds\leq ||x||_p||y||_q
\end{align}$$
Is this bound attained? $x(t)=|y_0|^{q-1}\text{sign}(y_0(t))$ the intuition is that this new function is $L^{p}$

### Technique
First find a hunch or good guess for $||f||=c$ you usually find it by $|f(x)|\leq c||x||$.

Then find an $x^\star$ so that $f(x^\star)=C||x^{\star}||$

### Example
let $f:C[0,1]\rightarrow \R$
$$\begin{align}
f(x)=x(t_0)
\end{align}$$
f is linear
$$\begin{align}
||f(x)||=||x(t_0)||\leq \max |x(t)| \leq ||x||
\end{align}$$
So the norm of $f$ is less than 1. Just pick $x(t)=1$

An unbounded functional $X$ is the set of polynomials:
$$\begin{align}
f(x)=\frac{dx}{dt}(1)
\end{align}$$
This is unbounded. Just take $x_n=t^n$

## Definition:
The set of all linear functionals is called the algebraic dual and is a vector space
$$\begin{align}
f_1,f_2\\
(\alpha f_1+\beta f_2)(x)=\alpha f_1(x)+\beta f_2(x)
\end{align}$$

So $X^*$ is a vector space. So it has an algebraic dual:
$$\begin{align}
g\in X^{**}\\
g:X^\star\rightarrow K
\end{align}$$
for a fixed $x_0$ define $g_{x_0}(f)=f(x_0)$. $g_x$ is linear define $C(x):X\rightarrow X^{**}=g_x$ in general:
$$\begin{align}
R(C)\subset X^{**}\\
R(C)\neq X^{**}
\end{align}$$
However $X$ is isomorphic to $R(C)$ bijective preserving length.

If $X^{**}$ is isomorphic to $X$ then we say that $X$ is algebraically reflexive.

Fhte dual of the dual is interesting because every member of your space should be part of this new space.
