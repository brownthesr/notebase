# Inner product spaces and hilbert spaces

## Definition

Let $X$ be a vector space equipped with an inner product $\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle$

Satisfies:

- conjugate symmetry
- positivity
- linearity in first argument

Any inner product space is also a normed vector space and a metric space:
$$\begin{align}
||x||=\sqrt{\langle x,x\rangle}\\
d(x,y)=||x-y||
\end{align}$$

Not all norms come from an inner product!

How to check if a norm comes from an inner product. Check if the parallelogram identity holds:
$$\begin{align}
||x-y||^2+||x+y||^2=2(||x||^2+||y||^2)
\end{align}$$

## polarization identity:
<!-- NOTE: This will be on the exam -->
$$\begin{align}
||x+y||^2-||x-y||^2=4 \text{re}\langle x,y\rangle\\
||x+iy||^2-||x-iy||^2=4 \text{im}\langle x,y\rangle
\end{align}$$
## Definition Orthogonal
$x\in X$ is orthogonal to y if $\langle x,y\rangle = 0$

if we have two subsets $A\subset X,B\subset Z$.

we can say sets are orthogonal as well.

### Examples
$x^TAy$ is an inner product if A is symmetric positive definite.

$L^2$ is an inner product space.

$l^2$ is also an inner product space.

if $p\neq 2$ $l^p$ is not an inner product space.:
proof:
$$\begin{align}
x=(1,1,0,0,\dots)\\
y=(1,-1,0,0,\dots)
\end{align}$$
Then $||x||_p=2^{\frac{1}{p}}i=||y||_p, ||x+y||_p=2=||x-y||_p$. Clearly the parallelogram identity does not hold.
$$\begin{align}
8\neq 4*2^\frac{2}{p}
\end{align}$$
This is only equal if $p=2$
# 3.2: Other properties

Cauchy Schwartz inequality
$$\begin{align}
||x-\alpha y||^2=||x||^2- \overline{\alpha}\langle x,y\rangle -\alpha \langle y,x\rangle +|\alpha|^2||y||^2\\
=||x||^2- \overline{\alpha}\langle x,y\rangle -\alpha (\langle y,x\rangle -\overline \alpha||y||^2)
\end{align}$$
if $y\neq 0$ otherwise the result is trivial. Choose $\overline{\alpha}=\frac{\langle y,x\rangle}{||y||^2}$ to kill the second expression:
$$\begin{align}
||x||^2-\frac{\langle y,x\rangle}{||y||^2}\langle x,y\rangle
\end{align}$$
and the result easily follows. If equality holds then $||x-\alpha y||=0$

Equality holds if and only if x and y are linearly dependent.

Triangle inequality with equality if and only if $x=\alpha y$ for non-negative $\alpha$

Triangle inequality proof
$$\begin{align}
||x+y||^2=||x||^2+2re<x,y>+||y||^2\\
\leq ||x||^2+2|<x,y>|+||y||^2\\
\leq ||x||^2+2||x||||y||+||y||^2\\
=(||x||+||y||)^2
\end{align}$$
## Lemma: All inner productions are continuous
proof:
$$\begin{align}
|\langle x_n, y_n\rangle -\langle x, y\rangle |\\
=|\langle x_n, y_n\rangle -\langle x_n, y\rangle +\langle x_n, y\rangle  -\langle x, y\rangle |\\
\leq \langle x_n, y_n\rangle -\langle x_n, y\rangle| +|\langle x_n, y\rangle  -\langle x, y\rangle|\\
\leq \langle x_n, y_n-y\rangle| +|\langle x_n-x, y\rangle |\\
\leq ||x_n||||y_n-y||+||x_n-x||||y||
\end{align}$$
So the whole thing on the right here goes to zero. So we get convergence.

## Definition: Hilbert space
A complete inner product space
## Theorem every inner product space can be completed
for any inner product space $X$ $\exist H$ Hilbert space and an isomorphism $A:X\rightarrow W\subset H$ where $W\bar=H$ and H is unique up to isomorphism

Proof: Complete $X$ into a Banach space $H$. Define the inner product:
$$\begin{align}
\langle \hat{x}, \hat{y}\rangle =\lim \langle x_n, y_n\rangle
\end{align}$$
The definition of the inner product in h can be shown to be independent of representative of that class.

## Theorem: Y is a subset of a hilbert space
- Y is complete if an only if it is closed
- y is finite dim then y is complete
- H is separable implies that y is separable
This allso all holds in banach spaces.
# 3.3: Orthogonal Complements and direct sums
## Definition: Segment
The segment joining $x,y\in X$ is:
$$\begin{align}
\{z=\alpha x+(1-\alpha)y:\alpha\in [0,1]\}
\end{align}$$

## Definition: Convex

We say that a subset $M\in X$ is convex if the segment joining $x,y\in M$ is a subset of $M$

## Defeinition: Distance to sets:
$$\begin{align}
d(x,M)=\inf_{y\in M}d(x,y)
\end{align}$$
can we find $y\in M$ so that $d(x,y)=d(x,M)$
## Theorem: Closest point
$M\subset X$ M is not empty and convex and complete. Then $\forall x\in X,\exists ! y\in M,d(x,y)=d(x,M)$

Proof: Existence

By definition of infimum there exists a sequence $y_n$ such that:
$$\begin{align}
||x-y_n||\rightarrow d(x,M)
\end{align}$$
if $y_n$ cauchy. take:
$$\begin{align}
||y_n-y_m||^2=||y_n-x+x-y_m||^2\\
=-||y_n-x-x+y_m||^2+2||y_n-x||^2+2||y_m-x||^2\\
=-||(y_n+y_m)-2x||^2+2||y_n-x||^2+2||y_m-x||^2\\
=-4||(y_n+y_m)/2-x||^2+2||y_n-x||^2+2||y_m-x||^2
\end{align}$$
note that $2|(y_n+y_m)/2-x|\geq 2d(x,M)$
$$\begin{align}
\geq4d(x,M)+2||y_n-x||^2+2||y_m-x||^2
\end{align}$$
and the other two converge to the same thing.

that means that $y_n$ is cauchy. so since M is complete these is a y that $y_n$ converges to

Furthemore we know that
$$\begin{align}
||y-x||\geq d(x,M)\\
||x-y||\leq ||x-y_n||+||y_n-y||\\
\leq d(x,M)
\end{align}$$
so it achieves this minimum.

We now prove uniqueness take:
$$\begin{align}
||y-y_0||^2=||(y-x)-(y_0-x)||^2\\
=-||y+y_0-2x||^2+2||y-x||^2+2||y_0-x||^2\\
=-4||(y+y_0)/2-x||^2+2||y-x||^2+2||y_0-x||^2\\
=0
\end{align}$$
So they must be the same.
## Lemma subspaces on unique points
Y is a complete subspace of X. take $x\in X$ there is a unique $y\in Y$ such that $||x-y||=d$ (since it is convex by applying previous theorme) and $x-y\perp Y$

Assume by way of contraciction that the optimal $x-y$ is not orthogonal to y. so there is some $y_1,\langle x-y, y_1\rangle =\beta$ thus:
$$\begin{align}
||x-y-\alpha y_1||^2=||x-y||^2- \overline{\alpha}\langle x-y, y_1\rangle -\alpha \langle y_1, x-y\rangle +|\alpha|^2||y_1||^2\\
=d(x,M)^2+ \overline{\alpha}\beta-\alpha( \overline{\beta}- \overline{\alpha}||y_1||^2)\\
=d(x,M)^2-|\beta|^2/||y_1||^2< d(x,M)^2
\end{align}$$
however we should be greater than the distance squared. so this is a contradiction.

## DEfintion direct sum
 X is the direct sum of the two subspaces if you can write any vector uniquely as a combination of vectors within the two subspaces.
## Orthogonal complement
$$\begin{align}
Y^\perp = \{z\in H|z\perp Y\}
\end{align}$$
then note that $Y^\perp = \text{span}(Y)^\perp, Y^\perp$ is also closed
## Theorem: **Closed** subspaces of **Hilbert** spaces have $H=Y\oplus Y^\perp$
proof:
Y is closed and $Y\subset H$ where $H$ is complete so Y is complete. Since Y is a subspace it must be convex. then there is a unique y for every x such that:
$$\begin{align}
d(x,Y)=d(x,y)
\end{align}$$
moreover $z=x-y\perp Y$ so $x-y\in Y^\perp$ so $x=y+(x-y)$. so a unique decomposition.LjL

To show uniqueness take $x+y=z'+y'$ so $x-x'+y-y'=0$ if you multiply both sides by $y-y'$ then we will get $||y-y'||^2=0$ and similarly for z
## Lemma: If Y is closed subspace then $Y=(Y^\perp)^\perp$
<!-- NOTE: This may be on the exam -->
we know that $Y\subset Y^p$. we know one direction. in the other direction take some $y\in Y^p$ then it can be written (Since Y is closed) as a combination of y and yperp so:
$$\begin{align}
y=x+z
\end{align}$$
but $y-x$ is in the double perp. so $z=y-x$ but z is in only the perp but its also in the double perp. so $z=0$ then $y=x$ so $x$ is in $Y$ then $x\in Y$

## Lemma: M is dense iff the perp is zero
assume that the span of M is all of H let $x\in M^\perp$. we want to s how that this is zero so there is a sequence $x_n$ in the span of M where x is in H. but since $\langle x_n, x\rangle =0$ by continuity $\langle x, x\rangle =0$ so $M^\perp = 0$.

in the other direction assume that the perp is zero. note then that we can write anything as the closure of the span of M and its perp. Since the perp  is zero $x=y$ so we can write anything as something in the closure of the span. So they are equal
