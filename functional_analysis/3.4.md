# Orthonormal sequences

Orthonormal sets are convenient to work with
$$\begin{align}
x\in X
\end{align}$$
X is an inner product space with:
$$\begin{align}
y=\sum_{k=1}^n \langle x, e_k\rangle e_k
\end{align}$$
Where $e_k$ is an orthonormal sequence of X then:
$$\begin{align}
x=y+z
\end{align}$$
Then y is the best inner product appoximation of x in the span of the basis vectors

Proof:
$$\begin{align}
||y||^2=\sum_{k=1}^n |\langle x, e_k\rangle |^2
\end{align}$$
furthmore we know that $\langle z, e_j\rangle = \langle x-y, e_j\rangle = \langle x, e_j\rangle -\langle y, e_j\rangle =0$

So the z is orthogonal to y. This shows optimality. Earlier we showed that there exists a unique point in the subspace such that $x-y$ is orthogonal to all of the space. but we showed if it was not orthogonal we can do better. so in this way if the residual is orthogonal then it is optimal.
$$\begin{align}
||x||^2=||y||^2+ ||z||^2
\end{align}$$
from here we get bessels inequality:
$$\begin{align}
\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}\left(\langle x, e_k\rangle^2 \right)\leq ||x||^2
\end{align}$$
# 3.5 (Last section on midterm)
## Theorem:
- Let $e_k$ be an orthonormal sequence in a hilbert space H then:
$$\begin{align}
\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(\alpha_k^2\right)\iff \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(\alpha_ke_k\right)
\end{align}$$
one converges iff the other converges. This is the same as saying that $\alpha_k\in l^2$

- $x=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(\alpha_ke_k\right)\implies \alpha_k= \langle x, e_k\rangle$. We make the assumption that x can be written in this way, but there could be xs that cannot be written in this way. So
- $\forall x\in H, \sum_{k=1}^\infty \langle x, e_k\rangle e_k$ converges as a result of bessels inequality
# 3.6 Total orthonormal sequences
## Definition: Total set
A set $M\subset X$ such that $\overline{\text{span}M}=X$. A total orthonormal set is the same idea but $M$ is orthonormal.

## Fact:
For any hilbert space $H\neq \{0\}$ it has a total orthonormal set.

Proof: In finite dimensions use gram schmidt. In infinite dimensions and separable you can still use gram schmidt still.

If in infinite dimensions and not separable then you must use zorns lemma.

## Fact: All total orthonormal sets of a hilbert space have the same cardinality (hilbert dimension)

## Theorem totality: let $M\subset X$ (IPS)
a) M is total that means then $x\perp M\implies x=0$
b) if x is complete then the property listed above implies that M is total

Proof:
Note Let H be the completion of X. Then $\overline{X}=H$ but since M is total then $\overline{M}=\overline{X}=H$. So since M is dense then its perp is the zero vector

b) if $X=H$ then by the same theorem (Since it was an if and only if)

## Theorem PArsevals and totality
IF you have an orthonormal set in a hilbert space. It is total in H iff $\forall x\in H$ parsevals identity holds.
## Theorem H is hilbert
a) H is separable implies that every orthonormal set is countable

b) IF H contains a total orthonormal sequence it is seperable.

Look at both proofs (just see the gist of the proofs) for previous two theorems
<!-- NOTE: Look at previous two proofs -->
## Theorem
Two hilbert spaces over the same field (real or imaginary) are isomorphic to each other iff they have the same hilbert dimension.

We are essentially saying that all separable hilbert spaces are just little l2
