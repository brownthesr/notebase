# Representations of functions in Hilbert space

## Theorem: Riez representation theorem

Every bounded linear functional f on a hilbert space $H$ can be represented as an inner product with something on the space:
$$\begin{align}
f(x)=\langle x, z\rangle
\end{align}$$
Where z depends only on f.

In addition conveniently $||f||= ||z||$. So hilbert spaces are reflexive

Proof:
for $f=0$ this is easy. What if $f\neq 0$ then the null space of $f\neq H$. So if the null space is not the whole space then the perp of the null space is not trivial

Let $z\in (N(f))^\perp,z_0\neq 0$ define $v=f(x)z_0-f(z_0)x$ then note that:
$$\begin{align}
f(v)=f(x)f(z_0)-f(z_0)f(x)=0
\end{align}$$
so v is in the null space, but we also know that $z_0\in (N(f))^\perp$ then take:
$$\begin{align}
\langle v, z_0\rangle =\langle f(x)z_0-f(z_0)x, z_0\rangle \\
=f(x) \langle z_0, z_0\rangle -f(z_0) \langle x, z_0\rangle
\end{align}$$
then $f(x)=\frac{f(z_0) \langle x, z_0\rangle }{\langle z_0, z_0\rangle }=\langle x, \overline{\frac{f(z_0)}{\langle z_0, z_0\rangle }}z_0\rangle$

using this we can define a S Sesqilinear form

We now just need to show that it is bounded
$$\begin{align}
||S||=\sup \frac{||Sx||}{ ||x||}\frac{||Sx||}{||Sx||}\\
=\sup \frac{|\langle Sx, Sx\rangle |}{||x||||Sx||}\\
\leq \sup \frac{|\langle Sx, y\rangle |}{||x||||y||}=||h||
\end{align}$$
moreover:
$$\begin{align}
||h|| = \frac{\langle Sx, y\rangle }{||x||||y||}\leq \frac{||Sx||}{||x||}=||S||
\end{align}$$
So they must be equal.

## Lax Milgram Theorem (Not in book)
This is extremely useful theorem to show existence and uniqueness for certain PDEs. This also motivates finite element methods

Let b be a bilinear form $b:H\times H\rightarrow \R$ where H is a hilbert space. Assume b is bounded. Assume that it is also coercive:
$$\begin{align}
\exists \beta>0, \forall x\in H, b(x,x)\geq \beta ||x||^2
\end{align}$$
let $f\in H'$ then there is a unique $x\in H$ such that $b(x,y)=f(y),\forall y\in H$. This is called a weak formulation of the problem. (we are mapping f to x).

Or equivalently:
$$\begin{align}
B:H\rightarrow H', (Bx)(y)=b(x,y), Bx=b(x,\cdot)=f_y(\cdot)
\end{align}$$
has a bounded inverse $B^{-1}:H'\rightarrow H$
<!-- NOTE: We shouldn't memorize this, but portions of this proof will come up on the test -->

Proof: instead of looking at B it is easier to look at:
$$\begin{align}
S:H\rightarrow H\\
b(x,y)=\langle Sx, y\rangle
\end{align}$$
We need to prove that S is injective. $Sx=0\implies \langle Sx, x\rangle \geq \beta ||x||^2\implies x=0$

We need to show that the range of S is closed (this is used in the next step where we use the projection theorem). Let $y\in \overline{R(S)}$ take some sequence that converges to $y_n\rightarrow y$.

Since $y_n\in R(S),\exists x_n\in H,y_n=Sx_n$.
$$\begin{align}
\beta ||x||^2\leq \langle Sx, x\rangle =b(x,x)\leq ||Sx||||x||\\
||Sx||\geq \beta ||x||
\end{align}$$
by cauchy
$$\begin{align}
\epsilon >||y_n-y_m||=||S(x_n-x_m)||\geq \beta||x_n-x_m||
\end{align}$$
so $x_n$ is cauchy so it must converge to some $x$ within H so $x_n\rightarrow x$ since $S$ is bounded $Sx_n\rightarrow Sx=y$ so $y\in R(S)$

we now need to show that $R(s)=H$ if $R(S)\neq H$ then $\exists z\in R(S)^\perp$ with $z\neq 0$ with $z\neq 0$

in particular $\langle Sz, z\rangle =b(z,z)\geq \beta ||z||^2=0$ so $z=0$

and this shows lax milgram because we have a surjective and injective. We also need to show that $B^{-1}$ is bounded.

## Application of Lax milgram to a 1d PDE
we need to show that a specific bilinear form is bounded and coercive
$$\begin{align}
-u''+au=f\\
u(0)=u(1)=0
\end{align}$$
Where a is continuous and $a(t)\geq a_0>0$ we assume that $f\in L^2$ so its in a hilbert space. and we have a test function $v$ that is continuously differentiable and zero at the boundaries.

take
$$\begin{align}
\langle -u''+au, v\rangle =\langle f, v\rangle \\
\langle u', v'\rangle +\langle au, v\rangle =\langle f, v\rangle
\end{align}$$
then we have a bilinear form
$$\begin{align}
b(u,v)=\langle u', v'\rangle +\langle au, v\rangle
\end{align}$$
b is bounded:
$$\begin{align}
|b(u,v)|\leq |\langle u', v'\rangle +|\langle au, v\rangle |\\
\leq \int_0^1|u'v'|dt+\max a \int_0^1|uv|dt\\
\leq ||u'||_{L^2}||v||+||a||||u||||v||\\
\leq \max(1,||a||)(||u'||||v'||+||u||||v||)\\
\leq\max(1,||a||)||u||_{H^1}||v||_{H^1}
\end{align}$$
where we used a special inner product for the last cauchy Schwartz.

Now note that $H^1$ is a hilbert space (for finite normed in the $H^1$ norm) with respect to the $H^1$ norm

b is coerciev
$$\begin{align}
b(u,u)=\int_0^1(u')^2dt + \int_0^1au^2dt\\
\geq \int_0^1(u')^2+a_0\int_0^1u^2dt\\
\geq \min (1,a_0)(\int_0^1 u'^2+u^2)\\
= \min(1,a_0)||u||^2_{H^1}
\end{align}$$
Now we can apply lax milgram. So if we have a $g\in (H^1)'$ then there is a unique $u\in H^1$ such that:
$$\begin{align}
b(u,v)=g(v)
\end{align}$$
where $g(v)=\int_0^1 fv,g\in (H^1)'$. Note that the particular one we chose is bounded by cauchy shwarts so it is in the dual space.
$$\begin{align}
\langle f,v\rangle \leq ||f||||v||_{L^2}\leq ||f||||v||_{H_1}
\end{align}$$
so our choice of g is bounded and thus in the dual space. This means that the weak formulation admits a unique solution for any $f\in H^1$

Phrased in the other way we would have $B:H^1\rightarrow (H^1)'$ and $B(u)(v)=b(u,v)$

## Another application
let $x\in H, g:H\rightarrow \R$ which is nonlinear, expand the taylor series:
$$\begin{align}
g(x+h)=g(x)+l(h)+e(h)
\end{align}$$
where $l$ is lienar.
$$\begin{align}
\frac{|g(x+h)-g(x)-l(h)|}{||h||}\rightarrow 0, h\rightarrow 0
\end{align}$$
the reiz representation theorem tells us that $\exists \nabla g(x), l(h)=\langle \nabla g(x),h\rangle$

# Hilbert Adjoint operators (3.9)

## Definition: Adjoint
Let $H_1,H_2$ be hilbert spaces. take some bounded linear operator between them $T:H_1\rightarrow H_2$. The adjoint $T^*$ satisfies:
$$\begin{align}
\langle Tx, y\rangle =\langle x, T^*y\rangle
\end{align}$$
## Fact:
The adjoint $T^*$ exists (as an application of the reiz representation theorem) and is unique with $||T||=||T^*||$

proof sketch:
$$\begin{align}
h(y,x)=\langle y, Tx\rangle
\end{align}$$
defines a sesquilinear form. it is possible to show that this form has the same norm as the operator $T$. We can use the reiz representation theorem to represent this as:
$$\begin{align}
h(y,x)=\langle Sy, x\rangle =\langle T^*y, x\rangle =\langle y, Tx\rangle
\end{align}$$
from the reize represntation theorem we get:
$$\begin{align}
||T^*||=||h||=||T||
\end{align}$$

### Example
The transpose of A a matrix exists and the norm of the transpose is the same as the norm of the original.

Say for another example say we have a operator between two $L^2$ spaces. This has an adoint as well.
