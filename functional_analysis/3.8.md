# Representations of functions in Hilbert space

## Theorem: Riez representation theorem
Every bounded linear functional f on a hilbert space $H$ can be represented as an inner product with something on the space:
$$\begin{align}
f(x)=\langle x, z\rangle 
\end{align}$$   
Where z depends only on f. 

In addition conviently $||f||= ||z||$. So hilbert spaces are reflexive

Proof:
for $f=0$ this is easy. What if $f\neq 0$ then the null space of $f\neq H$. So if the null space is not the whole space then the perp of the null space is not trivial

Let $z\in (N(f))^\perp,z_0\neq 0$ define $v=f(x)z_0-f(z_0)x$ then note that:
$$\begin{align}
f(v)=f(x)f(z_0)-f(z_0)f(x)=0
\end{align}$$
so v is in the null space, but we also know that $z_0\in (N(f))^\perp$ then take:
$$\begin{align}
\langle v, z_0\rangle =\langle f(x)z_0-f(z_0)x, z_0\rangle \\
=f(x) \langle z_0, z_0\rangle -f(z_0) \langle x, z_0\rangle 
\end{align}$$
then $f(x)=\frac{f(z_0) \langle x, z_0\rangle }{\langle z_0, z_0\rangle }=\langle x, \overline{\frac{f(z_0)}{\langle z_0, z_0\rangle }}z_0\rangle $
