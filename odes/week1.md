# Takeaways

Alright so the first thing to take away is if you have two solutions to a differential equation you can usually stitch them together to get many more solutions. This removes non-uniqueness.

The second thing is if you are working with a bound or an equation that has an integral in it, set that integral to a function and you can take that derivative of it. From this you can create some differential equation to solve.

Remember integrating factors for linear equations. They are usually exponentials

## Energy Method

For energy, first multiply by $\dot x$ from the rest. Then isolate the $\dot x^2$ term from the rest. This enables us to use positivity. We then can use integrating factors on the other side to better under stand things. note we will usually have a $\frac{d}{dt}(\dot x/2)^2=\ddot x\dot x$ term as well as a
